Overview:

The files in this folder demonstrate the usage of over-decomposition strategy along with Hybrid MPI+OpenACC code through a 2-D Jacobi relaxation example.

The code file corresponding to this example is stencil.f. The code for the over-decomposition strategy is in ./odvSched/odvSched.h and ./odvSched/odvSched.C.

A. Configuration:

   A configuration script is not used at this moment. Instead, one manually
sets the compiler and compiler flags for compiling the code.

B. Compilation:

   make clean; make;

C. Running:

Below is an example of a command used to run the example code.

  /opt/pgi/linux86-64/12.10/bin/mpirun -np 2 optirun stencil_MPIopenacc 32 32

The above is one instance of how the code can be run. The path for mpirun on your machine may be different. The stencil_MPIopenacc is one of the executables of the strategy for parallelizing the code. Executables corresponding to strategies generated by the Makefile are of the form stencil_<popt>, where popt is the name of the strategy. The numbers 256 and 256 are the x and y dimensions of the 2D mesh. The mesh is decomposed across the number of MPI processes specified to mpirun, in the case of the above, 2 MPI processes. The decomposition across processes is specified in the application example code stencil.f.


E. Experimentation:
 a. One can adjust the input matrix for the 2D mesh example in stencil.f by modifying line [207], where the initial values of the matrix are set to 50.0. The domain decomposition o the mesh is specified at line 243, where the decomposition is set to row domain decomposition.

 b. One can adjust tasklet size parameter of over-decomposition library by setting the TASKLET_SIZE environment variable to be equal to the size of the tasklet.
